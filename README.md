# WhatPulse-Alternative

This will probably be badly written and formatted cuz I have no idea how this works. Hopefully I will improve it later.

My goal with this is to make a program with the same or nearly the same functionality as the program called [WhatPulse](https://whatpulse.org/). It should monitor your inputs anywhere except if you are using a program with administrator privelages such as genshin impact.

The statistics that WhatPulse Alternative currently support are:
* Keyboard Usage
* Mouse Usage
* Network Usage

**Installation Instructions:**
- Download and install python. Make sure to check the box that says "add python 3.x to PATH" before installing.
- Download all the files by clicking on the green button labeled "Code" and then clicking on "Download ZIP".
- Unzip the download zip file in the folder where you want the program to be.
- Delete "README.md" because it is useless now.
- Open the command prompt in the folder where your downloaded files are and then run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Now you are basically done. You can run the "main.py" file for the program to run. **Only follow the next steps if you want the program to run on startup**, in other words, if you want the program to run everytime your computers is turned on.
- Right click on the "main.pyw" file and click on "Create shortcut".
- Press the windows key and r simultaneously. The run window will popup. Type `shell:common startup` and press enter. Finally, put the "main.pyw" shortcut you created earlier in the startup folder that you just opened using the run window.

**Usage Guide:**
When the program runs it adds itself to the system tray (that thing on the bottom right of your screen where steam or other game launchers run there). All you need to do is double click it or right click then choose "Show Stats". After that, a window will open showing all of your stats. Closing the stats window will not close the program itself. The program will stay working in the background. To stop the program from running, right click on it from the system tray and choose "Quit".
